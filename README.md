# go-restful-guide
A guide to build RESTful API using Go language

## Overview
This repository covers how to use Go language to build a RESTful API. All examples are organised in separated directories, each one covering a different concept from a basic API Server to API Versioning.

* Use of third-party packages has been kept to the minimum
* Use of web frameworks has been also avoided intenionally
* All examples use JSON and in some cases both JSON and XML (mostly content negotiation examples).

## Running examples
Examples can be executed from the parent directory as follows

```
go run <example>/*.go
```

For instance, to execute *echo* example:

```
go run echo/*.go
```
